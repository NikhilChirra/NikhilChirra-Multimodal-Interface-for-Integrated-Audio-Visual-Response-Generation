# NikhilChirra-Multimodal-Interface-for-Integrated-Audio-Visual-Response-Generation

• Engineered an audio-visual answering system integrating OpenAI's Whisper model for speech-to-text conversion and leveraged the BLIP model for image understanding to facilitate context-aware answers.
• Led the creation of a user-friendly interface that seamlessly accepts image and audio inputs, facilitating user interactions to solicit accurate responses from the model.
• Designed the project lifecycle, from conceptual design to deployment, with custom datasets of 100 images and 100 audio clips along with data processing in natural language and visual data.
